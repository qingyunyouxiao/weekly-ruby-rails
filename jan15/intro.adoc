Rails Simply Feels Right A large number of developers were frustrated with the technologies they were using to create web applications. It didn’t seem to matter whether they used Java, PHP, or .NET—there was a growing sense that their jobs were just too damn hard. And then, suddenly, along came Rails, and Rails was easier. But easy on its own doesn’t cut it. We’re talking about professional developers writing real-world websites. They wanted to feel that the applications they were developing would stand the test of time—that they were designed and implemented using modern, professional techniques. So, these developers dug into Rails and discovered it wasn’t just a tool for hacking out sites. For example, all Rails applications are implemented using the model-view controller (MVC) architecture. MVC isn’t a new concept for web development— the earliest Java-based web frameworks (like Struts) base their design on it. But Rails takes MVC further: when you develop in Rails, you start with a working application, each piece of code has its place, and all the pieces of your application interact in a standard way. Professional programmers write tests. And again, Rails delivers. All Rails applications have testing support baked right in. As you add functionality to the code, Rails automatically creates test stubs for that functionality. The framework makes it easy to test applications, and, as a result, Rails applica tions tend to get tested.
